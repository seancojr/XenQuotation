# About

XenQuotation is an add-on for the XenForo (http://xenforo.com/) community software. It allows members of your community to add and view quotations.

## Why

It's totally up to you why you want quotations, but the typical reason is so any particularly memorable quotes (e.g. funny, insightful, ridiculous, e.t.c.) can be saved away and found easily.

# Features

* Fully customisable permissions-based viewing, adding, editing, deleting and liking of quotations.
* Ability to add a random quotation to your forums sidebar.

* Quotations:
** Can be attributed to another member of your community or simply plain text (e.g. "Winston Churchill")
** Can have some context added to display near it (e.g. "Whilst live on air on BBC Radio 1")
** Can be created from a forum post (so that you can hop straight back to where it came from)
** Can use BB code (there are options to only allow specific BB code to be used, e.g. only allow [b], [i] and [u] only)

* Random quotation integrates with the [bd] Widget Framework (http://xenforo.com/community/threads/bd-widget-framework.11324/)
* Absolutely no core template modifications needed.
* Absolutely no changes to any XenForo source files.
